The author did a great job with it but there were some minor functionalities that were missing.  I decided to take some of his ([mattboldt](https://github.com/mattboldt)) wonderful work and port it into something a little more fluid that allows for more customizability. \r\n\r\nSome things I was looking to add were the capabilities to start/stop the typing actions, more customization for the cursor, pulling of strings from the page, etc...\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this wasn't straight copied from his work and there were a number of things I left out because I wanted to strip it down.  Maybe in the future I'll add some of those other functionalities in, but for now it is what it is.\r\n\r\n## Code Example\r\n    $( \"#divToPutText\" ).typeForMe({\r\n        whatToType: [\"String Options 1\", \"Another String\", \"Third times a charm\"],\r\n        shuffle: true\r\n        ...\r\n    });\r\n\r\nor to call a predefined function:\r\n\r\n    $( \"#divToPutText\" ).typeForMe('stopTyping');\r\n    \r\nHere are the available predefined functions:\r\n\r\n    'beginTypeProcess'      // Deletes and re-starts the typing\r\n    'stopTyping'            // Stops the typing\r\n    'startCursorBlink'      // Re-starts the cursor blink\r\n    'stopCursorBlink'       // Stops the cursor blink\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nAdd the typeforme.js file and a reference to JQuery. Then you can instantiate the plugin like so:\r\n\r\n    $( \"#divToPutText\" ).typeForMe();\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nYou can access a number of the defaults when creating the plugin instance. Here are the defaults:\r\n\r\n    $( \"#divToPutText\" ).typeForMe({\r\n        whatToType: [\"String Options 1\", \"Another String\", \"Third times a charm\"],\r\n        shuffle: false,                   // shuffle the strings\r\n        stringsElement: {                 // if pulling words from an element on screen\r\n            element: null,                // Element to pull from ('.class', '#div', etc...)\r\n            delimiter: \",\"                // delimiter to check for strings within the above element\r\n        },\r\n        typeSpeed: 70,                    // Speed of typing\r\n        startDelay: 0,                    // Delay at start\r\n        backSpeed: 0,                     // Backspacing speed\r\n        backDelay: 500,                   // time before backspacing\r\n        loop: false,                      // Keep looping text?\r\n        loopCount: false,                 // false = infinite\r\n        cursor: {                         // Cursor character\r\n            showCursor: true,             // Show blinking cursor\r\n            character: \"|\",\r\n            className: \"typeformeCursor\",\r\n            blinkInterval: 550\r\n        },\r\n        attr: null,                       // attribute to type (null == text)\r\n        contentType: 'html',              // either html or text\r\n        callback: function() {},          // call when done callback function\r\n        preStringTyped: function() {},    // starting callback function before each string\r\n        onStringTyped: function() {}      // callback for every typed string\r\n    });\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% always watching my projects so please be patient if you submit any questions/comments.  By all means I am always open to fixing any issues as well as answering some questions so feel free to blast away!\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\nhttp://ronaldpearl.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
